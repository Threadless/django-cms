Django CMS 2.0
==============

A django app for managing hierarchical pages of content in multiple languages, on different sites.

Django CMS handles the navigation rendering for you in multiple languages with i18n slugs 
and the navigation can be extended by your own models.

Pages are rendered with a template that has placeholders that get filled with plugins.

Plugins included at the moment:

* Text
* Picture
* Flash
* File
* Links

many more are in the works.

Plugins are very easy to write and you can easily write them on your own and connect them with your own models.
