Switch from MPTT to MP
======================

Since django CMS 2.0 we relied on MPTT (Modified Preorder Tree Traversal) for efficiently handling tree structures in the DB.
Over the years it proved that MPTT was not fast enough for big tree operations (>1000 pages) and regularly
the tree got corrupted because of transactional errors.

In 3.1 we replaced MPTT for MP (Materialized Path). MP is more efficient and has more error resistance then MPTT.
It should make the whole django CMS experience way better, faster and reliable.

Bofore upgrading
----------------

Be sure to run ``manage.py cms fix-mptt`` before you upgrade.
