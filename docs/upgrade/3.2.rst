3.2 release notes
#################

django CMS 3.2 introduces touch-screen support, significant improvements to the structure-board,
and numerous other updates and fixes for the frontend. Behind the scenes, auto-reloading following
apphook configuration changes will make life simpler for all users.

.. warning:: Upgrading from previous versions

    3.2 introduces some changes that **require** action if you are upgrading
    from a previous version. Please read :ref:`upgrade-guide-3.2` for a step-by-step guide to the
    process of upgrading from 3.1 to 3.2.


*****************
What's new in 3.2
*****************

* new welcome page to help new users
* full touch-screen support at all sizes from small tablets to table-top devices
* enhanced and polished user interface
* much-needed improvements to the structure-board
* enhancements to components such as the pop-up plugin editor, sideframe and the toolbar
* significant speed improvements on loading, HTTP requests and file sizes
* restarts are no longer required when changing apphook configurations
* a new content wizard system, adaptable to arbitrary content types
* new *Link/Button* look & feel


******************************
Changes that require attention
******************************

Bug-fixes
=========

* An issue om which ``{% placeholder %}`` template tags ignored the ``lang`` parameter has been
  fixed. However this may affect the behaviour of your templates, as now a previously-ignored
  parameter will be recognised. If you used the ``lang`` parameter in these template tags you may
  be affected: check the behaviour of your templates after upgrading.


Content wizards
===============

:doc:`/reference/wizards` can help simplify production of content, and can be created to handle
non-CMS content too.

For a quick introduction to using a wizard as a content editor, see the :ref:`user-tutorial`.


Renaming cms_app, cms_toolbar, menu modules
===========================================

``cms_app.py``, ``cms_toolbar.py`` and ``menu.py`` have been renamed to
``cms_apps.py``, ``cms_toolbars.py`` and ``cms_menus.py`` for consistency.

Old names are still supported but deprecated; support will be removed in 3.4.


Action required
---------------

In your own applications that use these modules, rename ``cms_app.py`` to ``cms_apps.py``,
``cms_toolbar.py`` to ``cms_toolbar.py`` and ``menu.py`` to ``menus.py``.


New ``ApphookReloadMiddleware``
===============================

Until now, changes to apphooks have required a restart of the server in order to take effect. A new
middleware class makes this automatic.

The new middleware class, ``cms.middleware.utils.ApphookReloadMiddleware``, is optional. If used,
this should be placed very near the top of your ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`` tuple in settings. This
middleware and other changes in the CMS for version 3.2 provide automatic reloading of URLs when
changes to an apphook are made.

.. note::

   This has been tested and works in many production environments and deployment configurations,
   but we haven't been able to test it with all possible set-ups. Please file an issue if you
   discover one where it fails.


For developers
==============

Various improvements have been implemented to make developing with and for django CMS easier. These
include:

* improvements to frontend code, to comply better with `aldryn-boilerplate-bootstrap3
  <https://github.com/aldryn/aldryn-boilerplate-bootstrap3>`_

* changes to directory structure for frontend related components such as JavaScript and SASS.

* We no longer use ``develop.py``; we now use ``manage.py`` for all development tasks. See
  :ref:`contributing_patch` for examples.

* We've moved our ``widgets.py`` JavaScript to ``static/cms/js/widgets``.


Code formatting
---------------

We've switched from tabs (in some places) to four spaces *everywhere*. See :ref:`contributing-code`
for more on formatting.


gulp.js
-------

We now use :ref:`gulp.js <js_linting>` for linting, compressing and bundling of frontend files.


SASS-related changes
--------------------

We now use `LibSass <https://github.com/sass/libsass>`_ rather than Compass for building static
files (this only affects frontend developers *of* django CMS - contributors to it, not other users
or developers). We've also adopted `CSSComb <http://csscomb.com>`_.


``.editorconfig`` file
----------------------

We've added a ``.editorconfig`` (at the root of the project) to provide cues to text editors.


Automated spelling checks for documentation
-------------------------------------------

Documentation is now checked for spelling. A ``make spelling`` command is available now when
working on documentation, and our `Travis Continuous Integration server
<https://travis-ci.org/divio/django-cms>`_ also runs these checks.

See the :ref:`spelling` section in the documentation.


New structure board
===================

The structure board is cleaner and easier to understand. It now displays its elements in a tree,
rather than in a series of nested boxes.

You can optionally enable the old appearance and behaviour with the
:ref:`CMS_TOOLBAR_SIMPLE_STRUCTURE_MODE` setting.


Replaced the sidebar with an overlay
====================================

The sidebar that could be expanded and collapsed to reveal a view of the admin and other controls
has been replaced by a simpler and more elegant overlay mechanism.


New startup screen
==================

A new startup mode makes it easier for new users to dive straight into editing when launching a new
site. See the :ref:`user-tutorial` for more.
