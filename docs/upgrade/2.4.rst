2.4 release notes (IN DEVELOPMENT)

*****************
What's new in 2.4
*****************

Removed the MultilingualMiddleware
==================================

We removed the MultilingualMiddleware. This removed the very ugly monkey patching of the
reverse() function as well. As a benefit we now support localization of urls and Apphook urls.

    Feature description

Minor improvements
==================

.. * Some minor improvement.


******************************
Backwards incompatible changes
******************************

New minimum requirements for dependencies
=========================================

If you are running django 1.3.X you need to install django-i18nurls, if you want
multilingual features. The cms.urls needs to be in a i18n url pattern.



********************
Pending deprecations
********************

* ``simple_language_changer`` will be removed in version 2.5. A bugfix makes
  this redundant as every non managed url will behave like this.
