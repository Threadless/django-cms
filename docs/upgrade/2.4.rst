2.4 release notes (IN DEVELOPMENT)

*****************
What's new in 2.4
*****************

Removed the MultilingualMiddleware
==================================

We removed the MultilingualMiddleware. This removed the very ugly monkey patching of the
reverse() function as well. As a benefit we now support localization of urls and Apphook urls with standard django helpers.


For django 1.4 more infos can be found here:

    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/i18n/translation/#internationalization-in-url-patterns

If you are still running django 1.3 you are able to archive the same functionality with django-i18nurl. It is a backport
of the new functionality in django 1.4 and can be found here:

    https://github.com/brocaar/django-i18nurls


What you need to do:

- Remove the MultilingualMiddleware from your settings.
- Be sure the LocaleMiddleware is in your settings.
- Be sure that the cms.urls is included in a i18n_patterns.
- Change your url and reverse calls to language namespaces. We now support the django way of
  calling other language urls either via '{% language %}' templatetag or via 'activate("de")' function call in views.
- reverse urls now return the language prefix as well. So maybe there is some code that adds language prefixes. Remove
  this code.

Minor improvements
==================

.. * Some minor improvement.


******************************
Backwards incompatible changes
******************************

New minimum requirements for dependencies
=========================================

If you are running django 1.3.X you need to install django-i18nurls, if you want
multilingual features. The cms.urls needs to be in a i18n url pattern.



********************
Pending deprecations
********************

* ``simple_language_changer`` will be removed in version 2.5. A bugfix makes
  this redundant as every non managed url will behave like this.
