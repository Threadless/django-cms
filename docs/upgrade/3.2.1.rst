What's new in 3.2.1
*******************

Improvements
============

- Adds initial support for Django 1.9
- Updates to work with Django Reversion 1.10+ (required by Django 1.9)


Bug Fixes
=========

- Fixed an issue with refreshing the UI when switching CMS language
- Fixed an issue with sideframe urls not being remembered after reload
- Added placeholder name to the edit tooltip
- Fix breadcrumb in page revision list
- Fix clash with Foundation that caused "Add plugin" button to be unusable
- Fixed a tree corruption when pasting a nested plugin under another plugin.


Treebeard corruption
====================

Prior to 3.2.1 moving or pasting nested plugins would lead to some non-fatal
tree corruptions, raising an error when adding plugins under the newly
pasted plugins.

To fix these problems, upgrade to 3.2.1 and then run ``manage.py cms fix-tree``
command to repair the tree.


DjangoCMS Text CKEditor
=======================

Action required
---------------
CMS 3.2.1 is not compatible with djangocms-text-ckeditor < 2.8.1.
If you're using djangocms-text-ckeditor, please upgrade to 2.8.1 or up.
