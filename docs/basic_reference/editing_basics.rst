Editing Basics
##############

This guide focuses on the basics of content creation and editing using django
CMS's powerful front-end editing mode.
This guide is suitable for non-technical and technical audiences alike.

This guide can only cover the basics that are common to most sites built
using django CMS.
Your own site will likely have many customizations and special purpose plugins
which we cannot cover here.
Nevertheless, by the end of this guide you should be comfortable with the content
editing process using django CMS.
Many of the skills you'll learn will be transferable to any custom plugins your
site may have.
