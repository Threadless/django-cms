Publish a page

|unpublished-page|

As an example, consider the *About* page that is currently in *draft* - only you
and other users with permission to edit the page can see it. To publish it so
that ordinary web visitors can see, click on page title and then hit
**Publish page now** |publish-page-now| (a window alert will ask you a
confirmation for publishing the page).

.. |unpublished-page| image:: /images/unpublished-page.png

Using the toolbar you can make further changes to the page: just click the
*Edit* |edit| button to activate the edit mode (you will notice that the ?edit
parameter will be appended to the querystring instead of ?edit_off).

Once you have finished editing, you can exit the edit mode and save the page
using the *Save and close* |save-and-close| button

.. |edit| image:: /images/edit.png
.. |save-and-close| image:: /images/save-and-close.png

Until you publish your changes, you can continue working on the draft without
affecting the published page.

You have now worked through the complete cycle of content publishing in django
CMS.
