Publish a page
##############

Your page is a *draft* - only you can see it. To publish it so that ordinary web visitors can see, hit **Publish changes**.

You'll notice that the toolbar indicates you're now seeing a *Live* view of
your page. If you want to make further changes:

* switch back to *Draft* mode
* make further changes in *Structure* or *Content* mode
* **Publish changes** when you're ready

Until you publish your changes, you can continue working on the draft without
affecting the published page.

You have now worked through the complete cycle of content publishing in django
CMS.
