App Integration
===============

It is pretty easy to integrate your own django applications with django-cms.
You have 4 ways of integrating your app:

1. App-Hooks
	
	Attach an apps urls.py to a page
	
2. Navigation Extenders

	Extend the menu with your own entries
	
3. Navigation Modifiers

	Modify the whole menu tree 
	
4. Custom Plugin

	Display your models / content in cms pages

App-Hooks
---------

CMS_APPLICATION_URLS

Put this in your settings.py.
Example:

	CMS_APPLICATION_URLS = (
		("myapp.urls", gettext("My Application")),
		("myotherapp.urls", gettext("My other Application")),
	)
