App Integration
===============

It is pretty easy to integrate your own django applications with django-cms.
You have 4 ways of integrating your app:

1. App-Hooks
	
	Attach an apps urls.py to a page
	
2. Navigation Extenders

	Extend the menu with your own entries
	
3. Navigation Modifiers

	Modify the whole menu tree 
	
4. Custom Plugin

	Display your models / content in cms pages

App-Hooks
---------

**`CMS_APPLICATION_URLS`**

With this settings you can add urls.py of your applications to a list
that will show up in the advanced settings tab of a page.

Put this in your settings.py.

Example:

	CMS_APPLICATION_URLS = (
		("myapp.urls", gettext("My Application")),
		("myotherapp.urls", gettext("My other Application")),
	)

Now edit a page and select an entry in the advanced settings tab. Save the page.
After this you need to restart the server because the urls are cached by django and 
in a multi-threaded environment we don't know which caches are cleared yet.

If you attached the app to a page with the url `/hello/world/` and the app has a urls.py 
that looks like this:

from django.conf.urls.defaults import *

	urlpatterns = patterns('sampleapp.views',
	    url(r'^$', 'main_view', name='app_main'),
	    url(r'^sublevel/$', 'sample_view', name='app_sublevel'),
	)
	
The 'main_view' should now be available at `/hello/world/` and the 'sample_view' has the url
'/hello/world/sublevel/'.
